Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

At the beginning, it was weird how the image goes inside the container that I created; I had forgotten how to style pictures properly, and this challenge helped me to reinforce that.

```css
#qr_picture_container img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

I learned that I need to use a container for an image; otherwise, the picture will not adapt to the container. I started using a div and managed to put the picture inside with a width of 100%.

I learned that using "margin: auto" will center the element.

I learned how to put elements at the bottom of the page.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I plan to continue using FlexBox to format the CSS websites until I feel comfortable using it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - I started using RM instead of px and this website helped me with the convertion
- [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
